# Rework Defect Codes
These are codes to classify why the item needs to be reworked if it is assigned to be reworked (rather than being scrapped or passed). These will be viewable in the Ledger Entries.  
These codes get passed to the Item Ledger entries to allows traceability, for example to see why the item was sent to the rework bin.
