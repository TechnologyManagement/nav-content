# Quality Process Management Overview
**Dynamics Additions Quality Process Management** allows you to manage Production Orders for quality before they go into stock. Goods are checked by a Quality Manager or Quality User. This Addition allows things to flow better and be traceable, and ones that do not pass can be assigned for reworking or for scrap. Rather than standard NAV, this Addition allows the use of Quality bins within the same location and provides a structure to record which items should be quality checked, how and what actions should be taken based on the results. A Quality Order is created from released Production Orders, so they are checked after the goods are produced and before it is put into stock for sale/despatch.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
