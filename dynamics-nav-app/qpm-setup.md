# Setup Quality Process Management
## Departments
A new section has been created in Departments called **Quality Process Management**. This contains **Setup** and **Order Processing**

## Setup
Setup covers the main areas required to begin using Quality Process Management.

These are all described in more detail in the following sections.

On top of this, the Locations that will be used as part of the quality process will need to have the two newly created fields completed.

## Quality Process Management Setup
These setup codes are mostly for posting, such as where scrap will post.

## Items
Each item that will be subject to the Quality process needs to have a copy of it created as a Scrap Item, these are linked via the new Quality FastTab which contains a new field called Scrap Item. The Item also needs Lot Tracking setup for Lot warehouse Tracking.

## Location Cards
Locations now have two new fields on the Location Card in the Bins FastTab, called Quality Scrap Bin Code and Quality Rework Bin Code.

## Testing Actions
These are the specific tests that will be applied to the produced item. These may be texture, colour, smell, taste, length, weight â€“ all depending on what is being produced.

The measurement units are specific to the test, for internal use, they are extra to the normal units of measure which the item is sold in.

## Testing Action Groups
These are used to group together related tests, to form a suite of tests.

## Measurement Units
These are set up separately and are specifically for use within the tests. They are for internal use by the company, not the customer. Measurement Units can also be access off the lookup on the Test Action card page.

## Rework Defect Codes
These are codes to classify why the item needs to be reworked if it is assigned to be reworked (rather than being scrapped or passed)

These will be viewable in the Ledger Entries. 

These codes get passed to the Item Ledges entries to allows traceability, for example to see why the item was sent to the rework bin.

## Test Actions by Item/Category
Here groups of tests can be assigned to specific items or types of items.
